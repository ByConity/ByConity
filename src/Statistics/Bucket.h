    //		We can think of this method as looking at the cartesian product of
    //		two histograms, with "this" being a bucket from histogram 1 and
    //		and "bucket" being from histogram 2.
    //
    //		The goal is to build a histogram that reflects the diagonal of
    //		the cartesian product, where the two values are equal, which is
    //		the result of the equi-join.
    //
    //		To do this, we take the overlapping rectangles from the original
    //		buckets and form new "squares" such that their corners lie on
    //		the diagonal. This method will take two overlapping buckets and
    //		return one such result bucket.
    //
    //		Example (shown below): this = [10, 14], bucket = [8,16]
    //
    //		The result will be [10,14] in this example, since "this"
    //		is fully contained in "bucket".

    //		The join of the two tables is the union of the join of each of the
    //		squares we produce, so we apply the formula to each generated square
    //		(bucket of the join histogram).
    //		Note that there are no equi-join results outside of these squares that
    //		overlay the diagonal.
