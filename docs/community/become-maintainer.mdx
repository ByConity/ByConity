Contributing to an open-source project like ByConity can be intimidating, but it can also be a rewarding experience. 
Becoming a maintainer or a member of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is a great achievement that requires technical and community contributions. 
Here's how you can become a maintainer and TSC member of ByConity:

**Step 1: Pick an Issue**

* The first step is to find an issue or feature to work on. 
* You can start by looking for issues labeled as "good first issue" or join existing pull request reviews.
* Alternatively, you can ask the maintainers to do a public live stream called "Let's talk about contributing" 
where they can explain a specific part of the project where you want to contribute.

**Step 2: Open a Pull Request**

* Once you've found an issue or feature to work on, you can start by forking the repository and working on it locally. 
* When you're ready, create a pull request with an appropriate title using the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).
* Make sure to test your changes against GitHub checks to ensure they all pass.

**Step 3: Get Pull Request Merged**

* After submitting your pull request, give the maintainers some time to review it. 
* If no one is alerted to review your PR, feel free to bring the issue to the maintainer's attention by pinging them on Slack or GitHub. 
* It's important to make sure all your PR checks pass before submitting to ensure your PR is merged quickly.

**Step 4: Invitation to Become a Committer**

* After making several contributions to ByConity, you will be recognized as a committer, and you will have the code commit right to the repository. 
* You can take this opportunity to review the pull requests of other developers and answer user questions, which will help you become more familiar with the code.

**Step 5: Invitation to Become a maintainer** 

* As a committer, you can continue to contribute to the project and share your knowledge with other contributors to earn enough credit to become a maintainer. 
* Once you become a maintainer, you'll have more responsibilities, such as reviewing and merging pull requests, managing issues, and ensuring the quality of the code.

**Step 5: Become a TSC Member**

* After becoming a maintainer and demonstrating technical and community influence, you can apply for TSC membership. 
* As a TSC member, you'll have the right to vote on community-related decisions and propose other active contributors for committership. 
* Being a TSC member is a great responsibility, and it requires dedication to the project and its community.

Remember, the most important thing when contributing to an open-source project is to have fun, learn new things, and build a community. 
Good luck!
