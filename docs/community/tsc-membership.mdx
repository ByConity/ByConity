This guide aims to provide information on how to become a member of the ByConity Technical Steering Committee (TSC). 
It outlines the development roles in ByConity, the definition of the TSC, why it was formed, its basic principles,

* **Maintainers:** Committers who have been elected due to their merit and contributions towards the development and evolution of the project. 
They have write access to the code repository, can vote on community-related decisions, and can propose other active contributors for committership.

## What is the Technical Steering Committee?
The TSC is a group of maintainers who contribute to the maintenance and governance of the ByConity Initiative. 
It is responsible for making decisions that affect the entire initiative, rather than just a single project. 
TSC members commit to participating in the voting process.

## Why the TSC was formed
The TSC was formed when ByConity was OpenSourced in 2023 to ensure a system of open governance that promotes ownership 
and neutrality of all participants in the initiative.

There are some basic principles of the TSC members
* No founding members with special privileges
* Equality among all contributors
* Asynchronous decision making 
* Every maintainer is allowed to automatically become a TSC member

## Benefits of becoming a TSC member

As a TSC member you will enjoy the following benefits: 
 
* Recognition from ByConity community
* Participation in the voting process on topics concerning the entire initiative
* Included in key decision-making for the Initiative. 

## How to become a TSC member

Any maintainer can become a TSC member. To become a TSC member, you need to become a maintainer of one of the projects in the ByConity Initiative.

You can become a maintainer by doing at least one of the following within the ByConity organization:
* Support and commit to existing projects
