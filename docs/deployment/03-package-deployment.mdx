# Package Deployment
One way to deploy ByConity to physical machines is using package manager. 
For example, install Debian package for Debian OS and rpm packages for Centos OS

## Install FoundationDB and HDFS
ByConity using FoundationDB as meta store, and HDFS as datastore. So before 
starting to deploy ByConity, we need to deploy FoundationDB and HDFS first.

For deploying [Foundation](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/) database, 
you can refer to the installation guide [here](./foundationdb-installation)

After that we need to deploy an HDFS cluster consist of name node and data node, 
and create the directory `/user/clickhouse` in HDFS for store data. You can refer 
to the installation guide [here](./hdfs-installation). 
After this step, you got the name node url which ussually the value of `fs.defaultFS` 
that you can find in the `core-site.xml` config. 

## Install FoundationDB client
Now we will start deploying Byconity. ByConity packages depends on the FoundationDB client package.
Hence, before deploying ByConity packages on any machine, we need to deploy FoundationDB client package first. 
The Foundation client package are tight coupled to version of FoundationDB server. 
So we need to choose the client package with version that match the version of FoundationDB server

To deploy FoundationDB client package, we go to the release [page](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases), 
find the right package to your OS and download it. For example, here i download version `7.1.27` for Debian OS, `amd64` machine.
```sh
curl -L -o foundationdb-clients_7.1.27-1_amd64.deb https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases/download/7.1.27/foundationdb-clients_7.1.27-1_amd64.deb
```

Then install with this command
```sh
sudo dpkg -i foundationdb-clients_7.1.27-1_amd64.deb
```

## Deploy ByConity Packages
Next we will deploy ByConity packages, you can find them in release [page](https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity/releases). 
Or you can build the package by yourself, in that case follow this [guide](https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity/tree/master/docker/packager).

### Install byconity-common-static
The first package that need to install is the common package `byconity-common-static`, 
this is the package that all other packages depend on.

```sh
sudo dpkg -i byconity-common-static_0.1.1.1_amd64.deb
```
After that edit configuration files `/etc/byconity-server/cnch_config.xml` and
 `/etc/byconity-server/fdb.config`.  The `cnch_config.xml` file contains service_discovery config,
  hdfs config, foundationdb cluster config path. The `fdb.config` is the cluster config file of 
  FoundationDB cluster. 


### Config `cnch_config.xml`

The `cnch_config.xml` file contains 2 parts that have to be configured by user,  
the `service_discovery` tag and the `hdfs_nnproxy` tags.
In ByConity there are 3 ways component can discover each other. The `mode` tag is used 
to specify the way. There are 3 modes: `local`, `dns` and `consul`
In the `local` mode, the user have to specify the ip address or host name of all components 
in this config file, by replace the place holder `{your_xxx_address}`, for example `{your_server_address}`, 
which the actually ip address of the component, for example, `10.0.2.72`. 

For the `hdfs_nnproxy` tags contains the address of HDFS name node 

### Config `fdb.config`

The `fdb.config` is the file for foundation db client to connect to FoundationDB server, 
you will have it after you config FoundationDB server. 
Read more in [here](./foundationdb-installation)


After that on the machine you want to install TSO service. Download the `byconity-tso` package and install.
```sh
sudo dpkg -i byconity-tso_0.1.1.1_amd64.deb
```
If this is the first time the package is install on system, it won't start immediately but in next reboot. 
You can check it status by
```sh
systemctl status byconity-tso
```
The config for tso service is located in `/etc/byconity-server/byconity-tso.xml`, you can config as you like 
but the default are good enough, to start it immediately execute
```sh
systemctl start byconity-tso
```
The next time you install this package again (for example, you want to upgrade), then you don't need to execute `start` command.

In the same way, install ByConity resource manager, ByConity server, ByConity worker, ByConity worker write 
and ByConity daemon manager. The `byconity-resource-manager`, `byconity-daemon-manger` and `byconity-tso` 
are light weight service so it could be install in shared machine with other package. 
But for `byconity-server`, `byconity-worker`, `byconity-worker-write` we should install them in separate machines.

```sh
sudo dpkg -i byconity-resource-manager_0.1.1.1_amd64.deb 
sudo dpkg -i byconity-server_0.1.1.1_amd64.deb 
sudo dpkg -i byconity-worker_0.1.1.1_amd64.deb 
sudo dpkg -i byconity-worker-write_0.1.1.1_amd64.deb 
sudo dpkg -i byconity-daemon-manager_0.1.1.1_amd64.deb 
```
You can install more workers in the same way. Each worker has a settings call `WORKER_ID` 
in the config file `/etc/byconity-server/(byconity-worker|byconity-worker-write).xml` to config `worker id` for worker, 
`worker id` have to be unique between workers, the default value of `WORKER_ID` in config file is empty. 
In that case the `worker_id` is automatically assigned to be the IP address of the host machine.
