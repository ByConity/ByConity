# Deploy ByConity to physical servers with a docker wrapper

The current way to deploy ByConity to physical servers is deployed via a docker wrapper. 
You can build the docker wrapper image from source code by following this [guide](https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity/blob/master/docker/executable_wrapper/README.md). 


Please follow the below steps:

- Checkout the config files and shell file from the ByConity repo https://github.com/ByConity/ByConity/tree/master/docker/executable_wrapper. 

- Deploy [Foundation](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/) database. You can refer to the installation guide [here](./foundationdb-installation). After this step you will have a **fdb cluster config** file default located in `/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster`. Copy this file to `./config/fdb.clsuter`
- Deploy an HDFS cluster consist of name node and data node, and create the directory `/user/clickhouse` in HDFS for store data. You can refer to the installation guide [here](./hdfs-installation). After this step, you got the name node url which ussually the value of `fs.defaultFS` that you can find in the `core-site.xml` config. 

- Update file `config/cnch_config.xml`: 
    - Update the value of `hdfs_nnproxy` tag to your hdfs namenode url. 
    - Update the `host` tag inside `service_discovery` tags with the approprate address, ussually the ip address of the machine where you plan to install ByConity

- Execute `make image_pull` to pull the docker image to your local
- For the machine you plan to deploy TSO, execute ./run.sh tso to run tso. And in the same way, go the other machine where you plan to run other component and execute below command to make it run.
- Execute `./run.sh server` on 1 machine to run server
- Execute `./run.sh read_worker` on 1 machine to run read worker. You can have many workers by repeated this command on different machines. And add the workers info in `service_discovery` tags in `config/cnch_config.xml` so that server can know them.
- Execute `./run.sh write_worker` on 1 machine to run write worker
- Execute `./run.sh dm` on 1 machine to run daemon manager. TSO and DM are light weight services and can be run in the same machine with server or worker for resource efficient.
- Execute `./run.sh cli` on the machine that run server or `./run.sh cli2 {server_address}` from any machine to connect to server using clickhouse-cli interface.
- To stop any component execute `./run.sh stop {component_name}` where `component_name` can be `tso`, `server`, .... After you stop if you want to run again then use `./run.sh start {component_name}` otherwise you have got an error about container already in use from `docker`.
