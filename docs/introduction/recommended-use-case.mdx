# Recommended Use Cases

# General Scenario

ByConity uses a large number of mature OLAP technologies, such as column storage engine, MPP execution, intelligent query optimization, vectorized execution, Codegen, indexing, data compression, mainly used in OLAP query and computing scenarios. It has very good performance in real-time data access, aggregation query of large and wide tables, complex analysis and calculation under massive data, and multi-table associated query scenarios.

| Scenario Category     | Scenario            | Description                       | Features                    |

# Multi-tenant isolation and resource sharing

In ByConity, users can specify a computing group for querying SQL to achieve physical resource isolation and avoid query interference between different tenants. Of course, in order to improve resource utilization, ByConity also supports resource leasing between computing groups to achieve resource sharing.

# Separation of reading and writing calculations

ByConity's storage-computing separation architecture makes it natively support storage-computing separation. insert uses a computing group dedicated to writing, and select uses a computing group dedicated to reading. The read and write jobs will not affect each other.

# Real-time scaling

ByConity's storage and computing separation architecture design makes it perfectly suitable for scenarios with dynamic expansion and contraction requirements, maximizing resource utilization and reducing costs according to actual resource requirements. ByConity's metadata and data are stored at the remote end. The stateless computing nodes make expansion and contraction very lightweight. You only need to wait for the computing instance to start up, and the service can be served immediately without additional data migration overhead, realizing real-time expansion. Shrinkage.
